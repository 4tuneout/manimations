some ways to view the lorenz equations on a 3d graph, started out as a file that outputs a manim render, then a browser compatible version, then a jupyter notebook, and the latest being a manim interactive scene where figuring out how to move the damn camera up was the bane of my existence

run command for maniminteract.py is manim -qm -p --renderer=opengl maniminteract.py LorenzAttractorOpenGL
run command for main.py is manim -pql main.py
